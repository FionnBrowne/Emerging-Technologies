    "- \"**Quantum computing** is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of *quantum states*, such as **superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations**. The devices that *perform quantum computations* are known as **quantum computers**.\" <br>It Started when a physicist named **Paul Benioff** who proposed a *quantum mechanical model* of the *Turing machine* in 1980. which at the time was used for mathmatical computation. These devices used symbols on a strip of tape and by minipulating these it was able to preform calculations, escentially they were used to see the limtations of what could be computed. The first two bit computations *quantum computer* was created by **Isaac Chuang**, **Neil Gershenfeld** and **Mark Kubinec** in 1998.<br>There has been significant investment in quantum computing since then in the private and public sectors such as google AI in 2019 with NASA, which they claimed managed to performed a *quantum computation* that was infeasible on any **classical computer**. <br>There are several variants of quantum computers, known as **quantum computing systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ##### *Quantum circuit:* is a computational routine consisting of coherent quantum operations on quantum data, such as qubits, and concurrent real-time classical computation. It is an ordered sequence of quantum gates, measurements and resets, all of which may be conditioned on and use data from the real-time classical computation. \n",
    "    - ##### A set of quantum gates is said to be universal if any unitary transformation of the quantum data can be efficiently approximated arbitrarily well as a sequence of gates in the set. Any quantum program can be represented by a sequence of **quantum circuits** and **non-concurrent classical computation**.<br><br>\n",
    "         <img src=\"images/Quantum_Circut_Components.png\" width=\"600\"><br>\n",
    "     - ##### Each horizontal line, or wire in a circuit represents a **qubit**, with the left end of the wire being the *initial quantum data*, and the right being the *final quantum data* generated by the *quantum circuit’s computation*. This quantum circuit uses three qubits and two classical bits. There are *four main components* in this quantum circuit.\n",
    "     - ##### A **quantum bit** or a **qubit** is the basic unit of *quantum information*. This is escentially the quantum version of the classic *binary bit* physically realized with a two-state device.<br>\n",
    "       1. **Initialization and Reset:** First, we need to start our quantum computation with a well-defined quantum state. This is achieved using the initialization and reset operations. The resets can be performed by a combination of single-qubit gates and concurrent real-time classical computation that monitors whether we have successfully created the desired state through measurements. The initialization of *Q0* into a desired state from *|O⟩* to *|ψ⟩*  can then follow by applying single-qubit gates.<br>\n",
    "       2. **Quantum gates:** manipulates the qubits as required by the algothrim. These are the equvilant to  classical **logic gates** and how there used for conventional *digital circuits*.\n",
    "       3. **Measurements:** takes in the quibits in the circut and takes a reading. A *classical computer* interprets the measurements of each qubit as classical outcomes *(0 and 1)* and stores them in the two classical bits.\n",
    "       4. **Classically conditioned quantum gates:** These gates are conditioned on the results of the measurements that are stored in the two *classical bits*. In this case, we are using the results of the **classical computation** concurrently in real-time within the same *quantum circuit*. Theses gates are Z & X.\n",
    "       <br><br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "2. ##### *Quantum Turing machine:* An early result from Bernstein and Vazirani (Quantum Complexity Theory ) shows that a quantum Turing machine can be used to simulate a classical Turing machine. This is enough to show that quantum Turing machines, and hence quantum computers, are Turing complete.\n",
    "    - Quantum Turing machine is used to model the effects of an quantum computer. Any quantum algorithm can be expressed formally as a particular quantum Turing machine, but computationally equivalent **quantum circuit** is a more common model.\n",
    "        - The **classical turing machine** is described by 7 tuple's M=(Q, T, B, ∑, δ, q0, F)\n",
    "            <img src=\"images/ClassicalTuring.png\" width=\"500\"><br>\n",
    "        - The basic construction of a quantum Turing machine resembles the classical Turing machine. We assume an infinite tape and the existence of a read/write head. With exception of the transition function δ, all other components of the definition can be reformulated canonically.\n",
    "            - The set of states **Q** is replaced by a Hilbert space.\n",
    "            - The tape alphabet symbols **T**  are likewise replaced by a Hilbert space.\n",
    "            - The blank symbol **b ∈ T**  corresponds to the zero-vector.\n",
    "            - The input and output symbols **∑** are usually taken as a discrete set, as in the classical system; thus, neither the input nor output to a quantum machine need be a quantum system itself.\n",
    "            - The transition function **δ** is a generalization of a transition monoid, and is understood to be a collection of unitary matrices that are automorphisms of the Hilbert space **Q**.\n",
    "            - The initial state **q0 ∈ Q** may be either a mixed state or a pure state.\n",
    "            - The set **F** of final or accepting states is a subspace of the Hilbert space **Q**.\n",
    "            \n",
    "3. ##### *Adiabatic quantum computer:* *AQC* started as an approach to solving optimization problems, with time it has become a alternative to the *Quantum Circut model* .\n",
    "    - **AQC** relies on the **adiabatic theorem** to do calculations. This nees the *Hamiltonian* which is the systems opperator corresponding to the sum of the energy in the system including kinetic and potential energy. The Hamiltonian is adiabatically evolved to the desired complicated Hamiltonian. Using the adiabtic theorem the system remains in the ground state. This makes it so at the end the state of the system describes the solution to the problem.\n",
    "        - **Adiabatic quantum computing** has been shown to be polynomially equivalent to conventional quantum computing in the circuit model.\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. ##### *One-way quantum computer:* In one-way quantum computation, the quantum correlations in an entangled state, which is physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others. This states is called a *cluster state* or a *graph state* are exploited to allow universal quantum computation through single-qubit measurements alone.\n",
    "    - The name “one-way” reflects the resource nature of the graph state. The state can be used only once (the resource state is destroyed by the measurements), and (irreversible) projective measurements drive the computation forward, in contrast to the reversibility of every gate in the standard network model\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ##### *Quantum cellular automata:* **QCA** is an abstract model of quantum computation, consist in arrays of identical finite-dimensional quantum systems, evolving in discrete-time steps by iterating a unitary operator G.\n",
    "    - **QCA** provide a model/architecture for distributed quantum computation. They encompass most of discrete-space discrete-time quantum theory."

    "\n",
    "- #### In a *quantum computer*, the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit. *Qubits* are made using physical systems, such as the spin of an *electron* or the *orientation* of a *photon*. These systems can be in many different arrangements all at once, a property known as quantum superposition.\n",
    "     - A smaller version of a quantum compurter is called a *photonic quantum computing*, which stores data on the **properties of photons**, or **light particles**. As for the light source needed for the *controllable photons* a **photon emitter** can be user. This can store *quantum information* based on the photons’ *polarization states*, or simply by asking which of two optical fibers a photon has traveled through.\n",
    "     - Next is **optical components** that can place photons itno *superposition* and apply gates, like a beam splitter that splits photons into one of two paths.\n",
    "     - Finally a camera/detector is required to determine what the final state of the photon is.<br><br>\n",
    " - #### In a Full **quantum computer** its about the size of a fridge with a wardrobe size of electronic equipment with a heart of qubits which stroe the information in quantum form. Here is how it works: Superfluids, Superconductors, Control, Superposition & Entanglement\n",
    "     1. First we use **superfluids** to chill **superconductors**. We get these **superconductors** very cold – about a hundredth of a degree Celsius above absolute zero: the theoretically lowest temperature allowed by the laws of physics.\n",
    "     2. When we put electrons through **superconductors** they pair up into something called Cooper pairs that *quantum tunnel* through something called a **Josephson junction**.\n",
    "     3. Essentially, this is a **superconducting qubit**. By *firing photons at the qubit*, we can control its behavior and get it to hold, change, and read out information.\n",
    "     4. A **qubit** itself isn’t very useful. However, by creating many and connecting them in a state called **Superposition** we can create vast *computational spaces*. We then represent complex problems in this space using **programmable gates**.\n",
    "     5. **Quantum entanglement** allows **qubits**, which behave randomly, to be perfectly correlated with each other. Using *quantum algorithms* that exploit **quantum entanglement**, specific complex problems can be solved more efficiently than on classical computers."
