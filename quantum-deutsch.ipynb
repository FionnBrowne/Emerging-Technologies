    "- \"**Quantum computing** is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of *quantum states*, such as **superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations**. The devices that *perform quantum computations* are known as **quantum computers**.\" <br>It Started when a physicist named **Paul Benioff** who proposed a *quantum mechanical model* of the *Turing machine* in 1980. which at the time was used for mathmatical computation. These devices used symbols on a strip of tape and by minipulating these it was able to preform calculations, escentially they were used to see the limtations of what could be computed. The first two bit computations *quantum computer* was created by **Isaac Chuang**, **Neil Gershenfeld** and **Mark Kubinec** in 1998.<br>There has been significant investment in quantum computing since then in the private and public sectors such as google AI in 2019 with NASA, which they claimed managed to performed a *quantum computation* that was infeasible on any **classical computer**. <br>There are several variants of quantum computers, known as **quantum computing systems**\n",

    "1. ##### *Quantum circuit:* is a computational routine consisting of coherent quantum operations on quantum data, such as qubits, and concurrent real-time classical computation. It is an ordered sequence of quantum gates, measurements and resets, all of which may be conditioned on and use data from the real-time classical computation. \n",
    "    - ##### A set of quantum gates is said to be universal if any unitary transformation of the quantum data can be efficiently approximated arbitrarily well as a sequence of gates in the set. Any quantum program can be represented by a sequence of **quantum circuits** and **non-concurrent classical computation**.<br>\n",

    "     - ##### Each horizontal line, or wire in a circuit represents a **qubit**, with the left end of the wire being the *initial quantum data*, and the right being the *final quantum data* generated by the *quantum circuit’s computation*. This quantum circuit uses three qubits and two classical bits. There are *four main components* in this quantum circuit.\n",
    "     - ##### A **quantum bit** or a **qubit** is the basic unit of *quantum information*. This is escentially the quantum version of the classic *binary bit* physically realized with a two-state device.<br>\n",
    "       1. **Initialization and Reset:** First, we need to start our quantum computation with a well-defined quantum state. This is achieved using the initialization and reset operations. The resets can be performed by a combination of single-qubit gates and concurrent real-time classical computation that monitors whether we have successfully created the desired state through measurements. The initialization of *Q0* into a desired state from *|O⟩* to *|ψ⟩*  can then follow by applying single-qubit gates.<br>\n",
    "       2. **Quantum gates:** manipulates the qubits as required by the algothrim. These are the equvilant to  classical **logic gates** and how there used for conventional *digital circuits*.\n",
    "       3. **Measurements:** takes in the quibits in the circut and takes a reading. A *classical computer* interprets the measurements of each qubit as classical outcomes *(0 and 1)* and stores them in the two classical bits.\n",
    "       4. **Classically conditioned quantum gates:** These gates are conditioned on the results of the measurements that are stored in the two *classical bits*. In this case, we are using the results of the **classical computation** concurrently in real-time within the same *quantum circuit*. Theses gates are Z & X.\n",
