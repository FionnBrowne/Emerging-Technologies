# What is this repository
***
## This repository contains lab work from my course Emerging technologies & my project on Scikit-Learn and Quantum computing. These notebooks demonstrate my work on the python packages `pandas` and `numpy` which will be required to work with various algothrims on jupyter notebook.


## This project containts two main Jupyter notebooks,
    1.scikit-learn
    2.quantum-deutsch
    
### Notebook (1) goes over various algothrims from sickit-learn [Machine Learning in Python](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). it also demonstates some visulation of data sets and gives some examples of why large companies use this site's algothrims.

### Notebook (2) covers a comparision of quantum computing and classical computing, ranging from there similarities and differences. It then coveres Deutsch's algothrim [Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/deutsch-jozsa.html), & simulates this using qiskit [Open-Source Quantum Development](https://qiskit.org/).

## How to run the notebook 
***

1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmder]() if on Windows.
3. Run `juypter lab`.

## How to run
***
# Requirements
-> Github
-> Jupyter Notebook + anaconda
-> Docker

# Getting ready.
-> Open cmd or the command prompt by going to the search box of windows and typing cmd.
-> In the command prompt/cmd navigate to your desired location you wish to save the files.
-> Create a file in the selected location by typing in: `$ mkdir fileNameHere` 
-> Enter this file Ex: type `$ cd Users/NewRepo` for cmd or `$cd Users\NewRepo` for command prompt
-> enter the following command to clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/FionnBrowne/Emerging-Technologies.git`

# Running the program

-> First navigate to repository location, for example: `$ cd Users/NewRepo/Emerging-Technologies`
-> To run any of the notebook just type `$ jupyter lab in the current directory`, or you could run the command `$ docker-compose up` to run it through docker  

# Possible fixes for issues ???
```python
def f(x):
    return x*x

```
