# Machine learning algothrims & Quantum computing
***

# What is this repository
***
## This repository contains lab work from my course Emerging technologies & my project on Scikit-Learn and Quantum computing. These notebooks demonstrate my work on the python packages `pandas` and `numpy` which will be required to work with various algothrims on jupyter notebook.
<br>

### This project containts two main [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
    1.scikit-learn
    2.quantum-deutsch
    
### Notebook (1) goes over various algothrims from sickit-learn [Machine Learning in Python](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). it also demonstates some visulation of data sets and gives some examples of why large companies use this site's algothrims.

### Notebook (2) covers a comparision of quantum computing and classical computing, ranging from there similarities and differences. It then coveres Deutsch's algothrim [Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/deutsch-jozsa.html), & simulates this using qiskit [Open-Source Quantum Development](https://qiskit.org/).
<br>
# What is it for
***
### To demonstrate a deeper understanding of machine learning and quantum computing while learning how to use juypter labs with docker in order to provide a concie and easy to understand repository .

# Requirements
***
1. Github account
2. Download [Anaconda]().
3. Download [cmder]() if on Windows.
4. Download [Docker]().

# Getting ready.
***
1. Open cmd or the command prompt by going to the search box of windows and typing cmd.
2. In the command prompt/cmd navigate to your desired location you wish to save the files.
3. Create a file in the selected location by typing in: `$ mkdir fileNameHere` 
4. Enter this file Ex: type `$ cd Users/NewRepo` for cmd or `$cd Users\NewRepo` for command prompt
5. enter the following command to clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/FionnBrowne/Emerging-Technologies.git`

## How to run
***
1. First navigate to repository location using either cmder or command prompt, for example: `$ cd Users/NewRepo/Emerging-Technologies`
2. To run any of the notebook just type `$ jupyter lab` in the current directory, or you could run the command `$ docker-compose up` to run it through docker

# Exploring
***
## You can mess around with the variables to see how it effects the visulization & data. Ex:  

```python
def f(x):
    return x*x

```

## Qiskit
